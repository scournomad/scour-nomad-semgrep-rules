      confidence: "High"
      impact: "Sanitization reduces XSS risk, but misconfiguration or bypasses may still allow exploitation."
      recommendation: "Prefer safe rendering; if using dangerouslySetInnerHTML, ensure robust sanitization (DOMPurify with strict config/Trusted Types) and validate sources."
