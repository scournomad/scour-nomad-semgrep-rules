    message: Potential header injection. Building Set-Cookie header from untrusted input.
    severity: WARNING

      - pattern: Response.Headers["Set-Cookie"] = $VAL
    metadata:
      cwe: "CWE-113: HTTP Response Splitting"

      severity: "High"
      risk_score: ""
      confidence: "Low"
      impact: "Untrusted values in Set-Cookie can inject CR/LF, corrupt headers, or set attacker-controlled cookies."
      recommendation: "Do not build Set-Cookie manually from untrusted input. Use cookie APIs and sanitize to reject CR/LF."
