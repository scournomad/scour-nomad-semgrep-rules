      severity: "High"
      risk_score: ""
      confidence: "Low"
      impact: "CR/LF injection in headers can split responses, enabling cache poisoning, header injection, or cross-user attacks."
      recommendation: "Sanitize and validate header values. Reject CR/LF in user-controlled input before assignment to response headers."

      verification:
        strategy: integration
        steps:
          - Send input containing CR/LF (e.g., %0d%0aInjected: value) through code path
          - Inspect response headers for injection
        expected_outcome: Header injection occurs if not sanitized
