    message: Potential unsafe XmlSerializer with dynamic XmlAttributeOverrides from untrusted input.
    severity: WARNING
    patterns:
      - pattern: new XmlSerializer($T, $OVERRIDES)
    metadata:
      cwe: "CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data"

      impact: "Untrusted overrides can manipulate serialization behavior to include unexpected types or structures."
      recommendation: "Do not construct XmlAttributeOverrides from untrusted input; restrict to vetted overrides and known types."
