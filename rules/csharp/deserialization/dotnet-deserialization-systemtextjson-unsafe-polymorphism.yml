    message: Potential unsafe polymorphic deserialization with System.Text.Json (unbounded type resolution).
    severity: WARNING
    patterns:
      - pattern-inside: |

    metadata:
      cwe: "CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
      owasp: "A08:2021-Software and Data Integrity Failures"
      severity: "Medium"
      risk_score: null
      confidence: "Low"
      impact: "Unbounded polymorphic resolution can allow unexpected types to be deserialized, risking gadget-like behaviors."
      recommendation: "Restrict polymorphism to known-safe types; prefer concrete models. Configure safe resolvers and ignore unknown types."
