    message: DES is obsolete and insecure. Use AES with CBC/GCM and proper key management.
    severity: ERROR
    pattern-either:
      - pattern: DES.Create(...)
      - pattern: new DESCryptoServiceProvider(...)
    metadata:
      cwe: "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm"
      owasp: "A02:2021-Cryptographic Failures"
      severity: "High"
      risk_score: null
      confidence: "High"
      impact: "DES uses small keys and is vulnerable to brute-force attacks; sensitive data encrypted with DES can be recovered."
      recommendation: "Replace DES with AES (prefer AES-GCM or AES-CBC with random IV) and use strong key management."
