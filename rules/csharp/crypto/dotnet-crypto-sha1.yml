    message: SHA1 is deprecated for security purposes. Use SHA-256 or stronger.

      cwe: "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm"
      owasp: "A02:2021-Cryptographic Failures"
      severity: "High"
      risk_score: null
      confidence: "High"
      impact: "SHA-1 is vulnerable to collision attacks, undermining integrity checks and signatures."
      recommendation: "Replace SHA-1 with SHA-256 or stronger (e.g., SHA-256/SHA-384/SHA-512). Re-issue signatures with modern algorithms."
