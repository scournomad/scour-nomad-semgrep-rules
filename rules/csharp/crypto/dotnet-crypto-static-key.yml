      cwe: "CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key"
      owasp: "A02:2021-Cryptographic Failures"
      severity: "High"
      risk_score: ""
      confidence: "Low"
      impact: "Hard-coded keys can be extracted, enabling decryption or forging MACs and compromising confidentiality and integrity."
      recommendation: "Do not embed keys in source. Use secure secret storage (e.g., Key Vault/KMS), environment configuration, and rotate keys regularly."
