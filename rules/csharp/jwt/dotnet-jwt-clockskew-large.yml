    message: Excessive ClockSkew may accept expired tokens for too long. Reduce skew (e.g., <= 5 minutes).
    severity: WARNING
    patterns:
      - pattern-inside: |
          new TokenValidationParameters { $OPTS }
      - pattern-either:
          - pattern: ClockSkew = TimeSpan.FromMinutes($M)

      severity: "Medium"
      risk_score: ""
      confidence: "Low"
      impact: "Overly permissive clock skew may allow expired or replayed tokens to be accepted beyond the intended validity window."
      recommendation: "Limit ClockSkew to a minimal value (e.g., 0–5 minutes) per operational needs; prefer strict validation in production."
